# About Me

Hello, this a page about me. My name is Shriyansh. And I am a CS Graduate student at NC State. This page is part of an assignment to be completed for my course- Software Engineering.  

I like coding in Python. Becaise it makes life very easy with the use of it's extensive library. You can solve String problems in basically a single line.  

For example:
```python
// Finding 'hackerrank' in a string 
import sys
q = int(input().strip())
for a0 in range(q):
    s = input().strip()
    b='hackerrank'
        print('YES' if re.search(r'.*h.*a.*c.*k.*e.*r.*r.*a.*n.*k.*',s) else 'NO')
```
