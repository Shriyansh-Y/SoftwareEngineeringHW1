### REST  
The submission file script.js includes function for each of the following:  
* listBranches in a given repo under an owner  
* createRepo to create a new repository   
* createIssue to create a new issue in the above created repository   
* editing a repo to enable wiki support  
* listing reactions to the above created issue in the aabove created repository  

All functions are in a single file. In case of any runtime issue, please run the 'createRepo' function first, and follow it up with the other functions in the same order to obtain the required results.
